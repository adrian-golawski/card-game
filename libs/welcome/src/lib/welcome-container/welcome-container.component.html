  <p>Welcome to my Card Guessing Game Demo!</p>
  <p>
    You will be guessing a relative value of the next card randomly picked from
    the deck. Each correct answer will give you 0.1 points. Draws are counted in
    your favor. The game lasts for 30 guesses.
  </p>
  <p>
    The game saves your progress after each move, so feel free to return any
    time you want.
